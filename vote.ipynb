    "### DIET VOTE: A replication of the roll call prediction program VOTE procedures.\n",
    "#### Translated from LISP to Python by Diego Alderete\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello. In this program, I undertook the task of replicating the publicly available LISP program VOTE by Stephen Slade and recreated it (to a much simpler degree) in Python as my final project for CPSC 458: Automated Decision Systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "VOTE is a database of bills, members of Congress, issues, and political groups. In addition to storing basic information like the name of a member or a bill, it stores the goals of these items and their relation to other items. This allows vote to draft decisions based on goals of agents, and with relationships to other agents and items, infer possible deeper goals of agents that were not explicitly stated.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the original VOTE program consisted of functions pertaining to natural language generation, database manipulation, and analysis of decisions made, this program is much less complicated due to time constraints and due to LISP being difficult to understand for an unexperienced first-year computer science student. I did not include any of the above mentioned, and there are fewer strategies that the <code>vote</code> function runs through.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have, however, put the BILLS, GROUPS, ISSUES, MEMBERS, and STRATEGIES files into a standardized JSON format as a gift for all future students of this class. Originally, all these agents and relationships were hard-coded into a LISP program that inserted them into the databases individually. They are now neatly organized into JSON format! Have fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "While everyone in the class has definitely read the book, there would be no sense in explaining how the program works, but I will do it anyways for posterity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **VOTE'S Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "VOTE works like this in the simplest terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every member's stances (or goals) are determined by their voting records. They are for the goals of the bills they have voted for, and they are against the goals of the bills they have voted against.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each member also has inferred stances. These inferred stances come from the goals of their allies. If their friend or constituents like a certain thing, they will most likely like that certain thing, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each bill also has stances.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After gathering our stances for the member, we find which ones are relevant to the bill.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Using these relevant stances, we use various strategies to see if we can make a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <code>load_databases.py</code> takes in the JSON files and makes the databases for bills, groups, issues, and members. Using these, we find and connect stances in <code>cg.py</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to run a VOTE**\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following command in your shell with <code>cg.py</code>, <code>load_databases.py</code>, and the database folder all being in the same directory."
